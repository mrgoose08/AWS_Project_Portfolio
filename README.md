AWS Mini-Projects Portfolio

Hi, I'm Aanand M, and this repository showcases my hands-on mini-projects built while learning and practicing AWS Cloud services.
Each project focuses on a specific AWS service or combination of services, demonstrating real-world skills in deploying, automating, and scaling applications on AWS.

Projects Completed

1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Launched and configured Ubuntu-based EC2 instances.

Hosted a static website on EC2 servers.

Set up security groups and SSH access.


2. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Created multiple IAM users, groups, roles, and policies.

Practiced security best practices like least privilege access.


3. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Created custom AMIs and launch templates for faster EC2 deployment.


4. S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Configured S3 buckets for object storage.

Enabled bucket versioning and hosted a static website using S3.


5. Lambda

Built serverless functions triggered by S3 object uploads.

Connected Lambda with SNS to send email notifications on new uploads.


6. SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Set up SNS topics and subscriptions for event notifications.


7. CloudWatch

Monitored AWS resources and configured alarms for EC2 instance metrics.


8. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Created custom VPC with public and private subnets.

Launched instances in private subnets accessible via a bastion (jump) server in the public subnet.


9. Load Balancer & Auto Scaling

Configured Application Load Balancers.

Set up Auto Scaling Groups triggered by CPU usage to maintain application availability.


10. Elastic Beanstalk

Deployed a static website using AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for simplified application management.

These mini-projects simulate real-world tasks like hosting applications, automating infrastructure, and managing scaling, all critical for cloud-based roles like DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, or Solutions Architect.

Each project helped reinforce:

Service connectivity and security

Automation and scalability

Monitoring and cost optimization

Real-world troubleshooting
